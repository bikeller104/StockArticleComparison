# StockArticleComparison

## User Story

As an amateur investor who lacks professionally paid tools:
I WANT to view stock information, pricing, & articles,
SO THAT I can make predictions of what the stock price may do.

## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I load the webpage I am presented with a search bar
THEN I can enter my search criteria (stock Ticker or Company name)
WHEN I search for a stock price over a certain date range
THEN I can view articles about that company during that date range
