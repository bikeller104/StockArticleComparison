# StockArticleComparison

## User Story

As an amateur investor who lacks professionally paid tools:
I WANT to view stock information, pricing, & articles,
SO THAT I can make predictions of what the stock price may do.

## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I load the webpage I am presented with a search bar
THEN I can enter my search criteria (stock Ticker or Company name)
WHEN I search for a stock price over a certain date range
THEN I can view articles about that company during that date range

## Description

This website shows historic articles and current articles along with a stock price to compare historical data and current trends to make informed decisions.

- This was the first group project in the coding bootcamp.
- We chose this because it seemed like useful information to have when deciding on stocks.
- We learned that working together helps a project to go along faster.
